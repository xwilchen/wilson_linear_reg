#Wilson Chen's Personal Machine Learning Package

## What is this package doing?
This package serves three purposes.
1. Practicing OOP programming and establishing good behavior of coding including documentation and git
2. Practicing math behind machine learning algorithms
3. Udacity MLE nanodegree's project "Upload a package"

## What's next?
1. Through out the time, I will be expanding this package by adding more algorithms such as logistics regression,KNN, and Neural Network.
2. If possible I would like to practice decoration and recursive function as well
